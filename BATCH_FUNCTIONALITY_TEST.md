# Batch Functionality Test Results

## Overview
Successfully implemented batch-based quantity selection in the cash management system where:
- 1 batch = 100 notes
- Users can increment/decrement batches using + and - buttons
- Manual batch input is also supported
- Total notes and amount are calculated automatically

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made:

1. **TypeScript Component (`cash-request-form.component.ts`)**:
   - Added `NOTES_PER_BATCH = 100` constant
   - Added `batchCounts` property to track batch counts per denomination
   - Added methods:
     - `getBatchCount(denomination)` - Get current batch count
     - `incrementBatch(denomination)` - Increase batch count by 1
     - `decrementBatch(denomination)` - Decrease batch count by 1
     - `updateBatchCount(denomination, batchCount)` - Set specific batch count
     - `updateQuantityFromBatch(denomination)` - Convert batches to notes

2. **HTML Template (`cash-request-form.component.html`)**:
   - Replaced simple number input with batch controls
   - Added increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons
   - Added batch count input field
   - Added display showing both batch count and total notes
   - Updated summary to show "X batches (Y notes)"

3. **CSS Styles (`cash-request-form.component.scss`)**:
   - Added comprehensive styling for batch controls
   - Styled increment/decrement buttons with hover effects
   - Added batch summary display with notes count and total amount
   - Responsive design for mobile devices

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: R10 Notes - 2 Batches
- Input: 2 batches of R10 notes
- Expected: 200 notes worth R2,000
- Result: ✅ PASS

### Scenario 2: R20 Notes - 3 Batches  
- Input: 3 batches of R20 notes
- Expected: 300 notes worth R6,000
- Result: ✅ PASS

### Scenario 3: R50 Notes - 1 Batch
- Input: 1 batch of R50 notes
- Expected: 100 notes worth R5,000
- Result: ✅ PASS

### Scenario 4: R100 Notes - 5 Batches
- Input: 5 batches of R100 notes
- Expected: 500 notes worth R50,000
- Result: ✅ PASS

### Scenario 5: R200 Notes - 2 Batches
- Input: 2 batches of R200 notes
- Expected: 200 notes worth R40,000
- Result: ✅ PASS

## User Interface Features

1. **Batch Controls**:
   - Clear labeling: "Batches Required (1 batch = 100 notes)"
   - Circular increment/decrement buttons with ABSA red/gray styling
   - Center-aligned batch count input field
   - Disabled state handling for out-of-stock items

2. **Summary Display**:
   - Shows both batch count and total notes: "2 batches (200 notes)"
   - Real-time calculation of total amount
   - Color-coded display (blue for notes, red for amount)

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Works on desktop and mobile devices
   - Touch-friendly button sizes
   - Proper spacing and alignment

## Technical Implementation

### Batch Calculation Logic:
```typescript
private updateQuantityFromBatch(denomination: NoteDenomination): void {
  const quantity = this.batchCounts[denomination] * this.NOTES_PER_BATCH;
  this.updateQuantity(denomination, quantity);
}
```

### Increment/Decrement Logic:
```typescript
incrementBatch(denomination: NoteDenomination): void {
  this.batchCounts[denomination] = (this.batchCounts[denomination] || 0) + 1;
  this.updateQuantityFromBatch(denomination);
}

decrementBatch(denomination: NoteDenomination): void {
  if (this.batchCounts[denomination] > 0) {
    this.batchCounts[denomination]--;
    this.updateQuantityFromBatch(denomination);
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The batch functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. Users can now:
- Select money in batches of 100 notes instead of individual notes
- Use intuitive increment/decrement buttons
- See real-time calculations of total notes and amounts
- View clear summaries in the review step

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while providing a more user-friendly batch-based interface.
